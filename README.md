# I2S_IDF_PoC

This is a set of ESP32 Arduino sketches that test I2S interface using IDF.
This has been created in order to help me understand how IDF works with I2S and how Arduino could use it.

Most of them are designed for using ES8388 Codec, but it can be easily changed to work with any I2S amplifier chip.
